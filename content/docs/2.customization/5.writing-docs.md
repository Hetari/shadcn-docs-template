# Writing Documentation

This guide explains how to create new documentation pages, the metadata required at the top of files, and the special components available to make your docs interactive.

## File Location

Documentation files are located in the `content/docs` directory. They are written in Markdown (`.md`).

- **Root Level**: `content/docs/my-page.md` becomes `/docs/my-page`.
- **Nested**: `content/docs/category/my-page.md` becomes `/docs/category/my-page`.
- **Ordering**: Prefix files or folders with a number (e.g., `1.introduction.md`, `2.setup.md`) to control their order in the sidebar navigation.

---

## Frontmatter (The header)

Every documentation file should start with a YAML frontmatter block. This block is used to define page metadata.

```yaml
---
title: My Page Title
description: A brief description of what this page covers.
navigation:
  icon: icon-home # Optional: Lucide icon name (prefixed with icon-)
links:
  doc: https://external-docs.com # Optional: Link to external docs
  api: https://api-reference.com # Optional: Link to API reference
---
```

### Fields:

- **`title`**: (Required) The title of the page. Displayed as the main `<h1>`.
- **`description`**: (Recommended) A subtitle for the page, also used for SEO.
- **`navigation.icon`**: (Optional) An icon displayed in the sidebar. We use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons).
- **`links`**: (Optional) Badges displayed at the top for quick access to external resources.

---

## Markdown Basics

You can use standard Markdown syntax:

- `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`
- `**Bold**`, `*Italic*`, `~~Strikethrough~~`
- `[Link Text](url)`
- `- List item` or `1. Numbered item`
- `> Blockquotes`

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers:

````markdown
```vue
<template>
  <div>Hello World</div>
</template>
```
````

````markdown
```typescript
const greeting = "Hello World";
```
````

---

## Component Previews (MDC)

This template includes custom Markdown Components (MDC) to display interactive UI components and their source code. See the [MDC Components](/docs/customization/mdc-components) guide for detailed documentation.

### `ComponentPreview`

Used to show a working component demo and its source code in a tabbed interface.

```md
::component-preview
---
name: Button
description: A basic button example.
align: center
---
::
```

The component will automatically:
- Look for the component in `components/demo/Button.vue` first
- Fall back to `components/ui/button/Button.vue` if not found
- Display both the interactive preview and source code in tabs

### `ComponentSource`

Used when you only want to show the source code of a component without the interactive preview.

```md
::component-source
---
name: Input
title: components/ui/input/Input.vue
---
::
```

### `CodeCollapsibleWrapper`

Wrap large blocks of content or code to keep the page clean. The wrapper will show a collapsed view with an "Expand" button.

```md
::code-collapsible-wrapper
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Very long code snippet here... -->
  </div>
</template>
```
::
```

---

## Advanced Markdown Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Use the `:kbd[]` syntax to display keyboard shortcuts:

```markdown
Press :kbd[⌘ K] to open the command menu.
```

### Tables

Create tables using pipe syntax:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
```

### Callouts

Use callout components for important information:

```markdown
::callout{type="warning"}
This is a warning callout.
::
```

## Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Titles**: Keep titles short and descriptive.
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Write descriptions that help users know if they are on the right page.
3. **Use Headings**: Break down long content into sections using `##` and `###` headers. This automatically generates the Table of Contents on the right side.
4. **Interactive Demos**: Whenever possible, use `::component-preview` to show components in action rather than just text.
5. **Code Examples**: Always include working code examples that users can copy and use.
6. **Consistent Structure**: Follow a consistent structure across your documentation pages.
7. **Number Your Files**: Use numbered prefixes to control the order of pages in navigation.
8. **Link Related Content**: Link to related pages and sections to help users navigate.

---

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.md`
- Use numbered prefixes for ordering: `1.introduction.md`, `2.setup.md`
- Group related files in directories: `content/docs/1.getting-started/`
- Keep filenames descriptive and concise

## Example Documentation File

Here's a complete example of a well-structured documentation file:

```markdown
---
title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to set up and use this template.
navigation:
  icon: icon-rocket
---

# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation! This guide will help you get started.

## Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Update the site configuration in `app/lib/siteConfig.ts`:

::component-source
---
name: SiteConfig
title: app/lib/siteConfig.ts
---
::

## Next Steps

- Read the [Customization Guide](/docs/customization/customization)
- Check out the [MDC Components](/docs/customization/mdc-components)
- Explore the [Composables](/docs/customization/composables)
```

## Tips for Writing Great Documentation

1. **Start with the problem**: Explain what problem your documentation solves.
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Use code examples and interactive demos.
3. **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly, but provide enough detail.
4. **Use visuals**: Screenshots, diagrams, and component previews help understanding.
5. **Keep it updated**: Documentation that's out of date is worse than no documentation.
6. **Test your examples**: Make sure all code examples actually work.
7. **Get feedback**: Have others read your documentation and provide feedback.

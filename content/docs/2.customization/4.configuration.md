# Configuration

This guide explains how to customize the core parts of the template, including the landing page and routing system.

## Landing Page

The landing page is located at `app/pages/index.vue`. It uses components like `PageHeader`, `PageHeaderHeading`, and `PageHeaderDescription` to create a hero section.

To change the content:

1. Open `app/pages/index.vue`.
2. Update the `title` and `description` constants in the `<script setup>` block.
3. Modify the template to add or remove sections.

---

## Routing

This template uses Nuxt's file-based routing. Files in the `app/pages/` directory automatically become routes.

- `app/pages/index.vue` -> `/`
- `app/pages/docs.vue` -> `/docs` (and all sub-paths if implemented as a catch-all)

### Content-based Routing

Documentation content is managed using Nuxt Content in the `content/docs/` directory.

- `content/docs/getting-started/1.introduction.md` corresponds to `/docs/getting-started/introduction`.

The routing follows the directory structure:
- Files in `content/docs/` become routes under `/docs/`
- Subdirectories create nested routes
- Number prefixes (e.g., `1.introduction.md`) control ordering but are removed from the URL

## Navigation

All navigation constants live in `app/lib/navigation.ts`. Three constants are exported:

```typescript
/** Top-level section pills shown in the sidebar and mobile menu. */
export const NAV_SECTIONS: NavItem[] = [
  { name: "Get Started", href: "/docs/introduction" },
  { name: "Components", href: "/docs/components" },
  { name: "Registry", href: "/docs/registry" },
  { name: "MCP Server", href: "/docs/mcp" },
  { name: "Forms", href: "/docs/forms" },
  { name: "Changelog", href: "/docs/changelog" },
];

/** Sidebar group titles (lowercased) that should never be rendered. */
export const SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_SECTIONS: string[] = ["installation", "dark mode"];

/** Individual page paths that should be hidden from the sidebar page list. */
export const SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_PAGES: string[] = ["/docs/introduction", "/docs/changelog"];
```

### `NAV_SECTIONS`

Drives the section pills in both the desktop sidebar and the mobile menu. Each item has:
- `name`: The display name of the section
- `href`: The URL path to navigate to

### `SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_SECTIONS`

Hides entire sidebar groups by title (case-insensitive). Useful for hiding installation or setup sections that you don't want in the main navigation.

### `SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_PAGES`

Hides specific pages by path from the sidebar page list. Useful for hiding landing pages or special pages that shouldn't appear in the navigation tree.

---

## Customizing Navigation

### Adding a New Section

1. Add an entry to `NAV_SECTIONS` in `app/lib/navigation.ts`:

```typescript
export const NAV_SECTIONS: NavItem[] = [
  { name: "Get Started", href: "/docs/getting-started/introduction" },
  { name: "API Reference", href: "/docs/api" }, // New section
];
```

2. Create the corresponding content directory and files in `content/docs/`.

### Hiding Pages from Sidebar

Add the page path to `SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_PAGES`:

```typescript
export const SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_PAGES: string[] = [
  "/docs/introduction",
  "/docs/changelog",
  "/docs/internal-notes", // Hidden page
];
```

### Hiding Entire Sections

Add the section title (lowercase) to `SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_SECTIONS`:

```typescript
export const SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_SECTIONS: string[] = [
  "installation",
  "dark mode",
  "deprecated", // Hides all pages under "Deprecated" section
];
```

## File Organization

### Content Structure

Organize your documentation files with numbered prefixes to control ordering:

```
content/docs/
├── 1.getting-started/
│   ├── 1.introduction.md
│   └── 2.installation.md
├── 2.customization/
│   ├── 1.customization.md
│   └── 2.mdc-components.md
└── 3.api/
    └── 1.reference.md
```

### Navigation Metadata

You can add `.navigation.yml` files to customize how directories appear in navigation:

```yaml
# content/docs/2.customization/.navigation.yml
title: Customization
icon: lucide:settings
```

This allows you to:
- Set a custom title for the section
- Add an icon that appears in the sidebar
- Control how the section is displayed

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use numbered prefixes** for files and folders to control ordering (`1.introduction.md`, `2.setup.md`)
2. **Keep navigation constants centralized** in `app/lib/navigation.ts`
3. **Use descriptive section names** in `NAV_SECTIONS` that match your content structure
4. **Hide internal or draft pages** using `SIDEBAR_EXCLUDED_PAGES`
5. **Organize content logically** in subdirectories that match your navigation structure
